This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and notes that accompany Aurélien Géron's book:
"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow"

Covers both Part 1 (Fundamentals of Machine Learning with `Scikit-Learn`) and Part 2 (Neural Networks and Deep Learning with `TensorFlow/Keras`)

This book provides a hands-on introduction to machine learning and deep learning using Python’s most powerful tools:
  - Scikit-Learn for traditional ML
  - Keras/TensorFlow for deep learning
No prior ML experience is required, and the book favors practical code over theory, making it perfect for beginners.

Prerequisites
Before using these notebooks, you should have:
  1. Basic Python knowledge
  2. Familiarity with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib
  3. Understanding of basic math concepts: calculus, linear algebra, probability, and statistics
